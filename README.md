# TileFlip
A simple puzzler game

This repository contains one of my earlier projects, a game called TileFlip. The code could use a refactor...

<b>How to play</b>
  Convert all tiles on the screen to one colour, either black or white, before running out of moves. Your selected tile is marked with purple borders. You can move with the arrow keys, and each time you move to a tile, it's color will be reversed.

## Demonstration
